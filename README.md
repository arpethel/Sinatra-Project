## A CRUD MVC app using Sinatra

I decided to make a recipe tracker called Snack Overflow. I wrapped it in Bootstrap with modern card layouts and a nice logo. I used ActiveRecord and sessions to handle user accounts.

This app allows users to create, update and destroy their own posts, and simply read other users posts.

This app could use some expansion, but I think it's a good start for my first Sinatra app.

Just clone this repo and drop the tables to create your own. Use 'shotgun' to run.

Feel free to let me know what you think!
